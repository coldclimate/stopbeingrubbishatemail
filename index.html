        <h1>Stop being rubbish at email</h1>
        <p class="lead">You've probably been sent a link here by a friend.  They're trying to help you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="row marketing">
        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <h4 id="bcc">Learn to use BCC</h4>
          <p>When you CC or Carbon Copy everyone into an email they can all see each others email addresses.  If they all know each other, or this is a group discussion this is fine, but where they don't know one another and might not appreciate having their personal details shared, this is bad news.  You've just crapped all over their privacy.</p>
        <p>Blind Carbon Copy means that everybody included can see who emailed them (you) but not each other. Use
         it</p>

          <h4 id="attachments">Don't attach huge files</h4>
          <p>You might be using broadband but your email might be read on a mobile, or a poor connection and trying to download the huge Word document full of photos you've just attached might take a week.  People also have limited amounts of email they can store in their inbox, and one chunky attachment might just blow that</p>

          <h4 id="caps">DON'T WRITE IN ALL CAPS</h4>
          <p>It's not more readable, it's not clearer, it doesn't even highlight the important bits. IT'S LIKE BEING SHOUTED AT.</p>

          <h4  id="signature">Your signature is never going to be read</h4>
          <p>Massive signatures with address, email, website, motto, advice, tips, explanatory notes, images and a helpful reminder not to print this email (Save the trees!) are rarely read.  Your company might require you to have a legal disclaimer but the more you add the less it will be read.</p>
          
        <h4 id="forwards">Don't forward circulars without checking them</h4>
          <p>It is unlikely there is a terrible new virus which is going to spread slower than you can forward this email.  Disney are not giving a $1 to everybody who forward an email. There is not a a perfume salesman in your area using rape drugs.  Check your sources before forwarding such emails, <a href="http://www.snopes.com/">Snopes</a> is an excellent reference.</p>
          
        <h4 id="lists">Replying to mailing lists</h4>
           <p>When replying to a mailing list email remember that all replies act like Reply To All, so unless the messsge is of direct interest to everybody on the list consider "replying off list" by changing the reply to the email address of the person who sent the original message. Most of a technical mailing list doesn't care if you're away that weekend.</p>
